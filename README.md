# Cpp-Pick-and-Place-Assignment
This repository hosts an assignment completed for a c++ robotics programming class. It uses user inputs and outputs to represent an industrial robot picking and placing objects in boxes in an optimal configuration.

Main rules:
- Boxes cannot hold negative numbers.
- Boxes cannot hold more parts than a larger size.
- The robot fills large boxes first, then moves to the next smallest box. There may be extra parts remaining.
