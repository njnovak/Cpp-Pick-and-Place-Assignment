# Cpp-Pick-and-Place-Assignment
This repository hosts an assignment completed for a C++ robotics programming class. It uses user inputs and outputs to represent an industrial robot picking and placing objects in boxes in an optimal configuration.

Main rules:
- Boxes cannot hold negative numbers.
- Boxes cannot hold more parts than a larger size.
- The robot fills the largest boxes that can be fully filled first, then moves to the next smallest box. There may be extra parts remaining.

To see documentation for the program created with Doxygen, see the /doc/html/_r_w_a01_8cpp.html file. To view it as a html webpage, you will need to download all of the files in /doc/html/ and colocate them before opening the _r_w_a01_8cpp.html
